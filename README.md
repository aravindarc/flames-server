This is a demo of the flames match making method, implemented using a linked list data structure, this demo intends to portray
a fun application of data structures.
The backend is flask, front end is html.
Run the server.py to start server.
After the server starts, 
1. if you want to access the webpage from the local machine, change the address in index.html to 'http://localhost:5000'
2. if you want to access over connected device, use ifconfig and find the appropriate ip and change address to 'http://ip:5000'
